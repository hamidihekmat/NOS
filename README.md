# Reflection

The goal of this project was to get comfortable with Typescript and UI component library...

What I learned....

- Fimilarized myself with `Typescript`, `Styled Components` & `CSS`
- Learned about `NextJS` image optimization and `SWR` caching
- Created resuable components to reduce code duplication
- Designed `responsive` UI layouts
- Created multiple custom hooks e.g `Intersection Observer` Hook for infinite scrolling
